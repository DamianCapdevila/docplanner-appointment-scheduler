Hi ​Sergio Damián​,

Thank you for submitting your technical task. After a thorough review, here’s some feedback on your implementation:

## Positives:

- **Code is runnable:** Overall, the code runs well. There was a small issue with environment variables, but that could be a local problem on our side.

- **Availability and Booking Logic:** You implemented key business rules such as preventing bookings in the past, which is great. The basic booking logic is in place.

- **Data Validation:** You’ve included structural validation checks, which ensures a decent level of data integrity.
Configuration: Your use of configuration and logging for warnings and errors is good, ensuring that the solution has a professional setup.

- **Documentation:** The documentation you provided is well-written and detailed, which made reviewing the solution easier. This is a big plus.


## Areas for Improvement:
- **Availability and Booking Logic:** There are some quirks with the availability feature, such as not being able to retrieve current-week slots. Booking logic allows double bookings for the same slot and wrong durations, which should be addressed for accuracy.

- **Architecture:** While there is an attempt at structure (Domain layer), it’s not fully realized. Controllers are handling too much logic, and the separation of concerns could be improved, particularly in handling responses from external services. The architecture appears a bit messy.

- **Simplicity and Design Patterns:** Some elements, like the use of AutoMapper and over-complicated flows, feel unnecessary and go against the principle of simplicity (KISS). Additionally, the service layer has some redundancy where one service just calls another without adding value.

- **Error Handling:** Error handling is done directly in controller actions rather than globally, which can lead to fragmented and inconsistent handling of errors.

- **Test Coverage:** No meaningful tests were identified, and it would be helpful to see more unit and integration tests, especially for critical business logic such as booking.

## Final Thoughts:

While you have a good foundation and clearly understand the basic requirements, there are several areas where the implementation could be simplified and improved for maintainability and scalability. In comparison with other candidates, there were some things that suggested you weren't senior enough for this particular role, like incomplete booking functionality and a lack of separation between business and infrastructure layers. However, we appreciate your effort, especially the thorough documentation, and encourage you to keep refining your skills.
